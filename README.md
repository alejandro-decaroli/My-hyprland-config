# My hyprland config
Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains my Hyprland configuration for Arch Linux. It's a simple setup and not very polished aesthetically, so Iâ€™ll keep improving it over time ðŸ’ª. Feel free to report any bugs, issues, or suggestions for improvementâ€”Iâ€™d be glad to hear from you. ðŸ˜€

Here are the keyboard shortcuts:

    SUPER + Q = Terminal
    SUPER + W = Kill window
    SUPER + E = File explorer
    SUPER + D = Discord
    SUPER + S = Slack
    SUPER + F = Firefox
    SUPER + C = Visual Studio Code

In the preview folder, Iâ€™ve included some photos of how it currently looks. You can also find some images in the wallpaper folder for you to use.
